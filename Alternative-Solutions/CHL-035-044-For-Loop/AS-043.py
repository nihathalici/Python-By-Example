Ask which direction the user wants to count (up or down). If they select up,
then ask them for the top number and then count from 1 to that number. If they
select down, ask them to enter a number below 20 and then count down from 20
to that number. If they entered something other than up or down,
display the message "I donâ€™t understand".
