Shift Code
========================================================

A shift code is where a message can be easily encoded and is one of the simplest codes to use. Each letter is moved forwards through the alphabet a set number of letters to be represented by a new letter. For instance, “abc” becomes “bcd” when the code is shifted by one (i.e. each letter in the alphabet is moved forward one character).
