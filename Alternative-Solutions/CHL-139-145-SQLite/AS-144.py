Using the BookInfo database, ask the user for an authorâ€™s name and then save all the
books by that author to a text file, with each field separated by dashes so it looks as
follows:

1 - De Profundis - Oscar Wilde - 1905
9 - The picture of Dorian Gray - Oscar Wilde - 1890

Open the text file to make sure it has worked correctly.
