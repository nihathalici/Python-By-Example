# Python By Example

This is my repo following the book "Python by Example" by Nichola Lacey.

Synopsis taken from the book:
"This book is a hands-on approach to learning programming. After minimal reading you are set a number of challenges to create the programs. You can explore and experiment with the programming language and look at the example solutions to learn how to think like a programmer."
